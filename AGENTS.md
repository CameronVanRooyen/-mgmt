# Repository Guidelines

This repo hosts the management platform monorepo.

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for all commit messages.
- Ensure `git status --short` shows a clean tree before committing.
- Use `docker compose up -d` to start local services for testing.
- Future documentation will describe package-specific commands. For now, run basic `npm test` in each workspace if available.
